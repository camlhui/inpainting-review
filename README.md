# Image inpainting

## Introduction

> Inpainting replaces or edits specific areas of an image. This makes it a useful tool for image restoration like removing defects and artifacts, or even replacing an image area with something entirely new. Inpainting relies on a mask to determine which regions of an image to fill in.

Recent advances in AI have enabled the generation of high-resolution, realistic images on demand through various guidance techniques such as text prompts and images. These breakthroughs are set to revolutionize industries like e-commerce, fashion, real estate, marketing, and the arts. Essentially, it automates, scales and extends capabilities traditionally provided by tools like Photoshop, unlocking new levels of creativity and efficiency.

In this context we will review here how current available solutions address challenges posed by furniture image editing with a focus on new objects addition to enhance or accessorize existing furniture displays.

## Benchmark dataset

Our benchmark dataset consists of ten carefully designed samples (image, mask, prompts), selected to evaluate the performance of different solutions across a range of quality and reliability criteria. These include:
- **Realism**, how natural and lifelike the inpainted regions appear.
- **Adaptability**, the ability to adhere to complex and diverse instructions
- **Unmask image preservation**, ensuring the unedited parts of the image remain unaffected.
- **Consistency** with unmasked areas, icluding alignment in lighting, reflections, shadows, style, perspective, and textures.
